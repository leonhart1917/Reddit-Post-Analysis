I have a tiny Python script that runs as a Docker healthcheck every few seconds.
I want a **fully static binary** (glibc or musl) with:

* Minimal startup (<=0.3s like PyInstaller, no `staticx` unpack delay)
* Runs in *any* base image (old glibc, Alpine/musl)
* No FUSE/AppImage dependencies
* Willing to build Python from source
* Already tried PyInstaller, staticx, Nuitka, Alpine static build → all hit roadblocks
